There are three complete games available, all of which are free for you to use however you like:

Shooting Gallery - Time-trial game where you must shoot as many given targets in the given amount of time by clicking with the mouse. To accomplish this, we draw graphics to the screen, read mouse input, calculate real-world time, and keep track of and display the score.

Spaceship - Control a spaceship as it flies through space. Avoid the incoming asteroids that progressively get faster and more frequent in order to survive for as long as possible. Project implements frame-safe movement of objects, reads keyboard input, dynamically spawns asteroids with an increasing level of speed and frequency, handles basic collisions, and features a basic main menu.

RPG - Standard action-RPG where you control a character with the ability to shoot projectiles at enemies that chase down the player. Utilizes spritesheet animations, basic AI, level generation and object spawning using Tiled, a game camera that follows the player, and collisions between objects of varying types.
